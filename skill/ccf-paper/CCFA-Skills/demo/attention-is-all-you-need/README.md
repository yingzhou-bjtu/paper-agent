# Attention Is All You Need - CCFA ICLR Closed-Loop Demo

This demo reads the original *Attention Is All You Need* paper, extracts the research idea, and runs the current 13-skill CCFA family as if the project were being prepared as an ICLR-style submission.

## Reading Order

1. `ccfa.yaml` - shared project state.
2. `artifacts/00-original-paper-reading.md` - motivation, problem, insight, method, results, contribution idea, and source writing pattern.
3. `artifacts/01-idea-document.md` - ICLR idea brief.
4. `artifacts/02-iclr-closed-loop-skill-run.md` - all 15 current skills and their concrete artifacts.
5. `artifacts/03-idea-review.md` - strict idea review before writing.
6. `artifacts/03-writing-draft.md` - writing-stage decisions and optimization record.
7. `paper/attention_iclr_submission.tex` - complete ICLR-style LaTeX manuscript.
8. `artifacts/04-review-and-rebuttal.md` - writing review, scientific review, integrity audit, rebuttal, and revision ledger.
9. `artifacts/05-submission-check.md` - ICLR format, build, anonymity, page, and artifact checks.
10. `artifacts/06-family-self-audit.md` - remaining CCFA family issues found by this demo.
11. `artifacts/official-data.md` and `artifacts/result-tables.md` - official values and evidence tables.
12. `skill-self-tests.md` - smoke prompts proving consolidated routing.

## Demo Bibliography Policy

The TeX file contains a clearly marked demo reference list. It includes the original Transformer paper and representative surrounding work so the demo reads like a real paper, but it is not a frozen recommended bibliography. In a real project, run `ccf-literature-searcher` for the target venue and contribution, then replace or expand the references according to the actual related-work scope.

## Build Check

The manuscript is intended to compile with `pdflatex` from `paper/`:

```powershell
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error attention_iclr_submission.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error attention_iclr_submission.tex
```

## What Changed From The Earlier Demo

The earlier demo was too short and route-oriented. This version produces a full manuscript, compiles the TeX, runs idea review before writing, records writing and scientific review, drafts rebuttal text, and lists remaining family problems. It keeps unsupported evidence explicit instead of filling gaps with invented values.
