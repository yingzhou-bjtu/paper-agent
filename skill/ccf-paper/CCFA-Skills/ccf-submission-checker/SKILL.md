# CCF Submission Checker

## Core Rule

Treat submission as a build, venue-policy, page-budget, and artifact-readiness gate. Use local venue guides for expected rules, then require official-policy freshness for final decisions. Do not rewrite paper content.

## Modes

- `venue-format`: template, page limit, anonymity, author block, supplementary and camera-ready rules.
- `package-check`: LaTeX/PDF build, metadata, fonts, page count, file structure, and submission checklist.
- `artifact`: code/data/model release plan, environment, seeds, hardware, licenses, artifact README, and reproducibility appendix.
- `full`: venue + package + artifact.

## Workflow

1. Identify venue/year/track, submission mode, project directory, TeX/PDF files, supplementary/artifact files, and deadline pressure.
2. Read `ccfa.yaml` when available. If absent, proceed with supplied files and state that project-state tracking is unavailable.
3. For venue questions, read `../ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/index.md` and the specific venue guide before checking official freshness.
4. For package checks, inspect compile status, page count, target page budget, anonymity, fonts, PDF metadata, template path, references, supplementary files, and required forms.
5. For artifact checks, build a reproducibility checklist: code, data, models, environment, seeds, hardware, license, access restrictions, and README.
6. Hand off to `ccf-paper-writer` for text/page rewrites: compression when over limit, expansion when a full manuscript is materially underfilled, and normal polishing when within budget. Hand off to `ccf-experiment-designer` for missing reproducibility experiments and `ccf-rebuttal-writer` for post-review response packaging.
