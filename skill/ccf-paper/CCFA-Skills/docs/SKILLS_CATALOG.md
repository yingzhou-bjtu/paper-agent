# CCFA Skills Catalog

This catalog is the public trigger-conflict index for the current CCFA family. If this document conflicts with a skill's `SKILL.md`, `SKILL.md` is authoritative.

## Merged Entries

| Removed standalone skill | Current owner | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ccf-workflow-planner` | `ccf-pipeline-orchestrator` | Planning and orchestration are the same project-control layer. |
| `ccf-paper-compressor` | `ccf-paper-writer` | Compression changes manuscript text and must share writing safeguards. |
| `ccf-writing-reviewer` | `ccf-paper-reviewer` | Writing review is a review mode, not a separate runtime owner. |
| `ccf-citation-auditor` | `ccf-integrity-auditor` | Citation verification is evidence integrity. |
| `ccf-figure-table-builder` | `ccf-experiment-designer` | Result figures/tables depend on experiment evidence and real numbers. |
| `ccf-artifact-packager` | `ccf-submission-checker` | Artifact readiness is submission readiness. |
| `ccf-venue-format-guide` | `ccf-submission-checker` | Venue format lookup is a submission gate; writing still reads venue references. |
| `ccf-resubmission-adapter` | `ccf-rebuttal-writer` | Resubmission follows reviewer-response and revision-ledger logic. |
| `ccf-paper-presenter` | `ccf-paper-writer` | Slides/posters/talk scripts are paper-derived writing outputs. |
| `ccf-doc-diagram-designer` | `ccf-skill-forger` | Docs SVGs are repository maintenance. |

## Conflict Rules

![Routing boundaries](../assets/ccfa-skills-routing.svg)

- Non-review workflow skills should follow the user's requested output shape. Their internal checklists are safeguards, not mandatory visible report templates.
- Review, audit, and submission-gate skills may remain structured because their job is traceable diagnosis and pass/fail risk control.
- Full-workflow and full-paper prompts should produce dense artifacts, not route summaries. A manuscript request should leave a manuscript; a closed-loop request should leave idea review, writing draft, review, audit, rebuttal, and submission-check artifacts.
- Idea exploration, rescue, and shaping go to `ccf-idea-optimizer`; explicit scoring/ranking goes to `ccf-idea-reviewer`.
- Recent-paper watching, competitor tracking, and "is there a new similar idea?" go to `ccf-literature-monitor`; deep related-work discovery and opportunity mapping go to `ccf-literature-searcher`; existing citation verification goes to `ccf-integrity-auditor`.
- In early research, a weak or crowded direction should produce rescue routes, narrowing options, and evidence-to-decide before `abandon` is used.
- Manuscript rewriting, compression, and presentation outputs go to `ccf-paper-writer`; judgment goes to `ccf-paper-reviewer`.
- PDF-to-exemplar conversion goes to `ccf-paper-to-exemplar`; actual manuscript drafting still goes to `ccf-paper-writer`.
- From-scratch submission manuscripts must be length-aware: underfilled drafts stay with `ccf-paper-writer` for expansion; overfilled drafts stay with `ccf-paper-writer` for compression; final page compliance goes to `ccf-submission-checker`.
- Real result tables and figures go to `ccf-experiment-designer`; docs diagrams go to `ccf-skill-forger`.
- Venue requirements, package checks, anonymity, and artifact readiness go to `ccf-submission-checker`.
- Reviewer responses, revision ledgers, and resubmission plans go to `ccf-rebuttal-writer`.

## Venue Guides

The legacy per-venue runtime layer remains reference-only:

- `ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/index.md`
- `ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/<venue>.md`

Use `ccf-paper-writer` for venue-aware manuscript text and `ccf-submission-checker` for venue/package compliance.
