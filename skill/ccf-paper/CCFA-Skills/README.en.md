A strong paper is rarely defined by the final PDF alone. What matters is the research storyline behind it: an unstable idea finds its position through literature, earns credibility through experiments, becomes a legible argument through writing, and is refined again through review and rebuttal. The hard part is not only drafting one introduction paragraph. The hard part is keeping the idea, evidence, experiments, narrative, and response aligned around the same research question.

CCFA Skills starts from that observation. It treats a CCF-A paper project as a research storyline that can be maintained, audited, and advanced over time, rather than as a one-shot text generation task. An idea should be shaped before it is defended. Experiments should serve explicit claims rather than merely fill tables. Writing should preserve evidence boundaries. A rebuttal should not be an improvised answer at the end of the process, but a traceable bridge to revision and resubmission.

The central insight is that paper quality comes from the quality of continuous decisions. Writing, review, integrity audit, submission checking, and rebuttal should not replace one another; they should keep separate responsibilities and hand off through the same project state. The v0.5 line therefore organizes the family into 15 stage roles, so each stage has a clear responsibility, each artifact has a home, and the system behaves more like a collaboration framework around the research storyline than a loose prompt collection.

## Workflow

The default paper-project loop is:

```text
project scaffold
  -> workflow orchestration
  -> idea optimization
  -> idea review
  -> literature monitoring / competitor tracking
  -> literature search
  -> experiment design
  -> writing exemplar extraction (optional)
  -> venue-aware writing
  -> scientific/writing review
  -> integrity audit
  -> submission package check
  -> rebuttal / revision ledger / resubmission
```

`ccfa.yaml` is the shared project-state file. It records `target_venue`, `stage`, `artifacts`, `claims`, `experiments`, `reviews`, `revision_ledger`, and `submission_checks`, so skills can hand off without overwriting each other's files.

## Merged Helper Capabilities

Do not install these old names as standalone runtime skills:

```text
ccf-workflow-planner

ccf-figure-table-builder
ccf-artifact-packager
ccf-venue-format-guide

## Artifact Contract

![Artifact contract](assets/ccfa-skills-artifacts.svg)

`ccfa.yaml` is a status spine, not the whole paper. Concrete outputs still live in idea briefs, literature notes, experiment plans, manuscripts, review reports, integrity audits, submission checks, and revision ledgers. Review and audit skills diagnose; writing changes go back to `ccf-paper-writer`.

## Output Policy

- Writing, polishing, compression, and presentation tasks should follow the user's requested output format.
- If the user provides LaTeX, preserve LaTeX; if the user provides Markdown, preserve Markdown.
- From-scratch manuscript requests read the target venue guide and page budget first; if missing, use the NeurIPS fallback.
- Submission-style full drafts should target the venue's main-body length. Underfilled drafts are expanded by `ccf-paper-writer`; overfilled drafts are compressed by `ccf-paper-writer`; final page compliance is checked by `ccf-submission-checker`.
- Non-review skills should produce concrete, information-dense artifacts.
- Review, audit, and submission-gate skills may remain more structured because their value is traceable diagnosis.
- No skill may invent results, citations, official rules, or reviewer conclusions.

## Venue Guides

Venue-specific LaTeX/template information is reference material:

```text
ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/index.md
ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/<venue>.md
```

Use `ccf-paper-writer` for venue-aware manuscript writing. Use `ccf-submission-checker` for page limits, anonymity, PDF metadata, camera-ready checks, and artifact readiness.
